# Finance-And-Supply-chain-Analytics-by-MySQL
Welcome to my SQL project on Finance and Supply Chain Analytics at AtliQ Hardware, completed as part of the Codebasics SQL Bootcamp.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses SQL to analyze real-world datasets from AtliQ Hardware, to uncover actionable insights related to:

* Sales performance
* Market dynamics
* Customer behavior
* Supply chain forecasting

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Atliq Hardware is struggling with slow and complicated Excel files as its data keeps growing. To address this issue, they established a team of data analysts to transition from Excel to MySQL. This move aims to improve efficiency and make better use of their data.

## PROBLEM OVERVIEW

The goal of this project is to explore the company’s data using MySQL. The team will study sales, customer behavior, market patterns, and supply chain
activities to discover useful insights that can help improve business decisions.


## 🛠️ Tools Used
* MySQL – For querying and transforming data.
* Excel – For basic preprocessing and data visualization
